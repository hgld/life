The latest EU Settlement Scheme statistics show that over 900,000 people have applied to the scheme.

Two-thirds of EU citizens who applied received settled status. For most this was because they had been resident in the UK for five years or more.

A third were granted pre-settled status.

Those with pre-settled status can stay for as long as they need to build up five years of continuous residence. Once they have five years of continuous residence they can apply for settled status.**y**

If youâ€™re an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen, you and your non-EU family members can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme free of charge.

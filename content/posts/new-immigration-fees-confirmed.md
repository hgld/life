Following the announcement of proposed increases to visa, immigration and nationality application fees, UK Visas and Immigration have announced the confirmed changes. For the most part these increases are in line with the proposals made earlier in the year. The main changes are:

*   visas linked most closely to economic growth, such as those offered to workers and students, will be increased by 2%
*   a 2% increase will apply to all visit visas to help maintain the UK’s position as one of the world’s top tourist destinations
*   an increase of up to 25% will apply to settlement, residence and nationality fees, as these routes deliver the most benefits to successful applicants
*   an increase of up to 33% for optional premium services offered by the Home Office such as the super premium service and priority visa services overseas
*   Fees for all sponsorship categories will be held at the current rates.

Standard applications for Settlement will now cost £1,195 for a main applicant and £2,676 for other dependent relatives. Standard applications for Naturalisation will now cost £1,236 (which now includes the £80 citizenship ceremony fee). The changes are being made as part of the Government’s ongoing drive to make the Home Office a self-funded system.

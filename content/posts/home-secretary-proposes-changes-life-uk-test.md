The Home Secretary has proposed a series of reforms to British citizenship. The reforms include proposals to reform the Life in the UK test to give greater prominence to the British values and principles expected of those wishing to call the UK their permanent home.  The Home Office says the proposals would ensure that the test is more relevant to daily life and culture in the UK. There are also proposals for tougher English language requirements for people applying for British citizenship. A public consultation will be brought forward on the Life in the UK test. He also outlined that powers to deprive individuals of their British citizenship will be applied to individuals convicted of the most serious criminal offences, where it is in the public interest. Arrangements for the Life in the UK Test will remain unchanged for now. Any changes to the test and study materials would be made and implemented after the completion of the public consultation.

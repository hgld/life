NHS workers, university staff and students in the North West of England will be taking part in a pilot of the new application process for the EU Settlement Scheme. EU citizens working at 12 NHS Trusts, and students and staff from three universities in Liverpool will be invited to make real applications for settled status through the new digital process. The pilot will allow those working on the scheme to test the new system. Using real applicants will help them make improvements ahead of the launch of the scheme towards the end of 2018. The pilot will begin on 28 August 2018. The initial pilot phase will be accessible by invitation only. Up to 4,000 applicants will be able to apply on a voluntary basis. Assuming they are eligible, all those who go through the process will be granted settled status. Certain features to be included in the full settlement scheme application process will not be available during the pilot. While the application process is conducted online, applicants for the pilot will need to attend an appointment with a Home Office representative who will help to take them through the process.

The Migrants' Rights Network are running a Q&A event on Friday 15 July for people concerned what happens next for EU nationals living in the UK. In the aftermath of the UK’s vote to leave the EU there is a great deal of uncertainty about what will happen to European citizens who have made the UK their home. This event will give people a chance to ask two experts questions about the consequences of this decision. At the event will be:

*   Colin Yeo, a leading immigration barrister with expertise in both asylum law and private immigration cases and the author of the Free Movement blog.
*   Steve Peers, Professor of EU Law & Human Rights Law at the University of Essex.

The free event will be taking place at Autograph ABP, near Old Street in London and is for anyone concerned about their situation or those who would like to have a better understanding of the implications of Brexit for migrants’s rights and EU free movement.

The latest advice from the government, dated 7 November 2017, has set out more details of a new settled status scheme for EU citizens. The government says the new system will be streamlined, low-cost and user-friendly. EU citizens will also be consulted on its design. EU citizens wanting to remain in the UK after Brexit will not have their applications refused on minor technicalities. Caseworkers considering applications will exercise discretion and the government expects most cases to be granted. The latest proposals from the government commit to:

*   giving EU citizens 2 years after Brexit to apply for settled status
*   minimising the documents applicants need to provide
*   enabling caseworkers to contact applicants to resolve minor issues
*   making the cost similar to a British passport
*   giving unsuccessful applicants a right of appeal
*   introducing a digital, streamlined and user friendly application system
*   not requiring EU citizens to have sickness insurance or provide fingerprints
*   a simpler, lower cost process for those who already have permanent residence documentation

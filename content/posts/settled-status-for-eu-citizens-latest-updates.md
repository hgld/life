The Home Office and Ministers have given provided more updates on plans to offer a new special 'settled status' for EU citizens resident in the UK. The key elements of the plans are:

*   EU citizens who have lived continuously in the UK for 5 or more years, by 31 December 2020,  will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by getting 'settled status'. That means they will be free to live in the UK and have access to the same rights and services they do now. They will also be able to go on to apply for British citizenship under the existing rules.
*   EU citizens who are living in the UK on 31 December 2020, but won’t have been resident for 5 years when the UK leaves the EU, will be able to apply to remain until they have reached the 5 year threshold. Once they have been resident for 5 years they can also apply for 'settled status'.
*   Family members who are living with EU citizens in the UK by 31 December 2020 will also be able to apply for 'settled status', usually after 5 years in the UK.
*   Close family members (spouses, civil and unmarried partners, dependent children and grandchildren, and dependent parents and grandparents) will be able to join EU citizens after exit, where the relationship existed on 31 December 2020.

EU citizens with settled status or temporary permission to stay will have the same access as they currently do to healthcare, pensions and other benefits in the UK.   Settled status will be granted to those who have been in the UK for five years or more at the end of the implementation period. For those of you - or your friends - who don’t yet have five years residency on that day, the 31st December 2020, we will make sure that you will be able to stay to make up these years, so you can apply for settled status when you have. We have committed to giving you until June 2021 to submit an application for settled status - and we have made a commitment in the Withdrawal Agreement that this application system will be smooth, streamlined and low cost. I know that the French community in the UK is long established, and for those who have already acquired permanent residence documents I would like to stress that there​ ​will​ ​be​ ​a​ ​simple​ ​process​ ​to exchange​ ​this​ ​for​ ​a​ ​settled​ ​status​ ​document​ ​completely free​ ​of​ ​charge.​ ​​ ​This will also be available to people who have documents demonstrating Indefinite Leave to Remain, such as those who came before the UK joined the EU. In addition, those who acquire settled status will be able to leave the country for up to 5 years, without losing their right to return. In this respect we have gone further than existing EU law which only allows for an absence of 2 years in the permanent residence process. No clarification on requirements for EU citizens to register their presence in the UK.

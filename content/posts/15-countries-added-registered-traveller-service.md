The UK government expanded the Registered Traveller service to 15 new countries on 5 October 2017. The Registered Traveller service allows approved members, who have undergone advanced security checks, faster entry at the UK border through ePassport gates or the UK/EU passport lane. To apply, you must have an eligible passport and visa, or have visited the UK at least 4 times in the past 2 years. The following countries can now use the service:

*   Andorra
*   Bahamas
*   Botswana
*   Holy See (Vatican City)
*   Macao
*   Maldives
*   Monaco
*   Namibia
*   Nauru
*   Papua New Guinea
*   Samoa
*   Seychelles
*   St Vincent and the Grenadines
*   Tonga
*   Trinidad & Tobago.

The service has also recently expanded to include the children of members. This allows families to travel together more easily. More information and application forms are on [the Registered Traveller pages of the GOV.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/registered-traveller).
